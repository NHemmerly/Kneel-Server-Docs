# Imaging

Have you ever wanted to try out some form of linux and during the installation process you accidentally ***deleted*** an entire partition dedicated to your Windows installation?  No? Well for those that haven't, it is a very frustrating and inconvenient thing to happen, and it has the chance to happen often if you enjoy tinkering with different operating systems.

The reason I am writing is because I recently reinstalled *Fedora* Linux in a partition on the same drive as my Windows 11 installation, and I ruined my Windows 11 installation. It was a very silly mistake, but now I'm prompted to learn how to make good backups to prevent my situation from happening again!

## Creating a Bootable ISO

ISO files are files that are an exact copy of data that exists on different types of digital media. ISO files can be used to make an exact copy of an entire operating system, it should be pretty clear why ISOs are great for backing up important systems. 

There are several ways to create bootable ISO images of an operating system. I'll cover just one great way to make a bootable clone of an existing operating system.

## Clonezilla

[Clonezilla live](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live.php) is a free software useful for creating bootable backups. I will be going over how to install Clonezilla as a live USB, so backups can be made of any operating system on any computer. 

### Windows with Rufus Utility 

[Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) is a utility for Windows that automatically installs a bootable ISO onto a connected USB drive. Rufus is useful for both creating a Clonezilla thumb drive as well as creating an installation drive for created backups. 

After downloading the Clonezilla live iso file and installing Rufus, the process is fairly straightforward.
