## Network Hardware

The network hardware listed below is subject to change as I learn more about networking. I am also planning on moving at some point in the near future, and my network hardware and structure is likely to change with the move. 

Cable Modem plus Router:
  - Motorola MG7700

Powerline Ethernet Adapter:
  - TP-Link AV1000 Adapter

TP-links powerline ethernet adapters provide a great solution for users who live in a home where they are unable to pull cabling for wired network connections. The powerline adapters make use of existing home copper cabling to transmit a network signal from a switch or router in one room to any other room in the house.
